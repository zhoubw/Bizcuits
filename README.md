##Description
- Users suggest/express the desire for particular businesses in areas.

##To do list
- [x] Setup (This isn't the first thing to do because it requires us knowing what to do first)
 - [x] All members have all apis
 - [x] All members have tested and can fork properly
- [x] All members link this to their SoftDev pages
- [x] Network of pages: I will come up with this in the near future
- [x] Pick a good layout (what are you going to use)
- [x] I like MongoDB. Do you? If not, we'll do something with sql. (Decide what database we use)
- [x] Add more to-do things for the process below:
- [x] Start working on database. (More things to do here and everything below, tbd)
- [x] Start working on the front page, with design. Why front page first? Because things have to work.
- [x] Start working on the basic "suggestion" page, without design. We don't need things to look good yet; we need it to work.
- [x] A neat idea I came up with: Control Center. It's a site that's basically an interface used to manage the posts. This way they can be accessed without digging into the code. Do it or not?
- [x] Another idea: pins on a Google map?
